# ThreeLetterWord
WHAT IT DOES:

Enter in ANY word of any length (preferably larger than 2 letters, otherwise results are boring) and it will spit out every possible word that can be made 
from the letters of your inputted word. Currently it only keeps the length the same, so it won't output a 3 letter word if you give it a 9 letter word.

WHY THOUGH?:
Because this was originally a student program I made my first year of university. I completly rewrote the way that it generates the randomized words
as well as adding an option to filter out duplicates. I wanted something simple to improve as opposed to my grand ideas that I don't have time for, 
and I found this on my hard drive.

CAN IT BE IMPROVED?:

Yes, there are two TODO's I left, as well as a few other ideas I'd like to improve eventually:
1: Implement a way for generated "words" to be compared to a dictionary of the English Language, so it only can output actual English words, and not nonsense.
2: Allow for results to be of any length, as opposed to always words of the given length.
3: Output results to a text document, so they are easily viewed and saved.
4: An actual UI could be nice, but not needed. That's not something I do well, however.
5: I'm sure my algorithims are bad. They likely can be improved. 
6: I didn't bother to clean up the code for this first release. So a code cleanup.
